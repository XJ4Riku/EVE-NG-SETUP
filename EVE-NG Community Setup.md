## Purpose
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is designed  to provide a clear and repeatable process for installing **EVE-NG community edition**, loading **Device Image**, fixing **PHP Warning**, and creating **Lab**. 
This ensures proper configuration, and compatibility with the target system while maintaining best practices for academic or lab environments.

The procedure aims to facilitate:
  * The procedure ensures setup and configuration of virtual network labs in EVE-NG, enabling users to efficiently emulate complex network topologies for testing and training purposes
  
    
## Application
This SOP applies to students, lab assistants, or IT trainees using EVE-NG for hands-on learning, certification prep (e.g., CCNA), safe experimentation, multi-vendor exposure, collaborative labs, applying theory (e.g., VLANs), cost-effective practice, intro to automation, real-world scenarios, and guided troubleshooting in a virtual network environment.

It is relevant in circumstances such as:
 * Converting from Cisco Packet Tracer to EVE-NG environment for more advanced emulation and multi-vendor support.
 * Transitioning from theoretical study to practical, scalable network simulations.
 * Conducting group labs where physical hardware is limited or unavailable.
 * Preparing for real-world scenarios by simulating enterprise-grade network setups.
 * Practicing automation and scripting in a controlled, virtualized environment.

## Definitions
**EVE-NG(Emulated Virtual Environment - Next Generation)** : A network emulation platform that allows users to create and test virtual network environments. Itâ€™s widely used by IT professionals for learning, training, and simulating complex network setups without physical hardware.\
**VM (Virtual Machine)** : A software-based emulation of a physical computer running an operating system and applications.\
**CISCO** : An American multinational digital communications technology conglomerate corporation.\
**Packet Tracer** : A computer networking simulation software for teaching and learning networking, IoT, and cybersecurity skills in a virtual lab.\
**WinSCP** : An open source free SFTP client, FTP client, WebDAV client, S3 client and SCP client and file manager for Windows.\
**Filezilla** : A free, open source FTP client supports FTP, SFTP, and FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS) is available on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
